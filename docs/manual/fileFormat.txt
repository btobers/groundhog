Groundhog digitizer file format

50 byte header block followed by repeating traces, ended with magic bytes that
denote sucessful closure of the file. If the bytes are absent then the digitizer
program was interrupted. This does not necessairly mean that the data in the file
is bad, just that it is not complete.

Header:
Bytes:  Data
00-04: 0xD0D0BEEF
04-12: Samples per trace (int64)
12-20: Pre-trigger samples (int64)
20-28: Pulse repetition frequency (int64)
28-36: Stacking (int64)
36-38: Trigger threshold (int16)
38-46: Sampling frequency (float64)
46-50: 0xFEEDFACE

Trace:
Bytes: Data
00-26: ISO 8601 extended system time string (ex: 2023-05-04T22:16:50.512647)
19-??: Trace data (int64). Length of segment is 8*(samples per trace)

End of file:
Bytes: Data
??-??: 0xDEADDEAD
