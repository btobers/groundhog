An example of the graph produced by \verb:plotRX.py: when the transmitter and receiver are working properly. The positive and negative polarity amplitude spikes (to roughly +/- 3500 counts) are the transmitter pulses. The darker region of the plot is ambient noise and reflected pulses. This is from a particularly high ambient noise environment, which causes the apparent amplitude of the pulses to fluctuate.^^E^^L
